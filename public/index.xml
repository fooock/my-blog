I will explain the main components of these solutions one by one, the topics around each one and the technologies that can be used. Remember that I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on this topic, just a curious guy, and I can make mistakes. If so, leave me a comment please!, I will be happy to talk with you about this and exchange some opinions.</description></item><item><title>Manage libvirt with Python, TLS and SASL</title><link>https://blog.fooock.com/posts/1/manage-virtual-machines-with-libvirt-and-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 19:46:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.fooock.com/posts/1/manage-virtual-machines-with-libvirt-and-python/</guid><description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the libvirt is, then the official web page can clarify some things:

In this post I will show you how to interact with libvirt using Python and the KVM hypervisor, but first things first.
