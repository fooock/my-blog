This is a huge topic, but I will apply here the phrase *divide and conquer*. I will explain the main components of these solutions one by one, the topics around each one and the technologies that can be used. Remember that I'm not an expert on this topic, just a curious person, and I can make mistakes. If so, leave me a comment please!, I will be happy to talk with you about this and exchange some opinions.

To make this post small and simple, I will define the scope of the virtualization solution that I will implement and deploy. I want to build a solution to manage my own home servers throught a web platform. Why not use one of the existing solutions in the market?. Well, I want to have fun and learn new things. To resume, I want a challenge!.

If you ever used [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/6f2ea013e5c7), then you used the pretty face of a complete virtualization solution but on a big scale, also called IaaS (*Infrastructure as a Service*). The purpose of an IaaS is to abstract all hardware, servers, networks, storage etc and offer it as an online service. The topic is bigger, but we will maintain it small. Go go go!.

### Let's get started

First, at a high level, we need to identify each component. Each of these components, produces logs, has security implications, needs to be available as much time as possible and has to respond to performance requirements.
